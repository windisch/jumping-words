From Wikipedia: Dyslexia, also known as reading disorder, is
characterized by trouble with reading despite normal intelligence.
Different people are affected to varying degrees. Problems may include
difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words,
"sounding out" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud
and understanding what one reads. Often these difficulties are first
noticed at school. When someone who previously could read loses their
ability, it is known as alexia. The difficulties are involuntary and
people with this disorder have a normal desire to learn.
